# Scholarship Management System (Ongoing)

trash ui for now bruh, just trynna go with the functionalities

# FIX
- file path for the renewal submissions. (file path of the files after submitting renewal)
- generate a file inside the uploads with their name format.
- inside the generated file, contains the uploaded requirements (image/pdf/png)
- update display in the view renewal admin page, update the file pathing

I decided to try build our **group final project** as part of learning **backend development**.  
It's a web-based **scholarship management system**.  

My goal is to just **practice backend and database** while creating a functional project.  
This helps me understand **how the frontend communicates with the backend**, and how data flows between a Backend and a Database.
