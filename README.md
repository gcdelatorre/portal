# Scholarship Management System (Ongoing)

I decided to build our **group final project** as part of learning **backend development**.  
It's a web-based **scholarship management system**.  

My goal is to just **practice backend and database ** while creating a functional project.  
This helps me understand **how the frontend communicates with the backend**, and how data flows between a Backend and a Database.
