# Scholarship Management System (Ongoing)

trash ui for now bruh, just trynna go with the functionalities

I decided to try build our **group final project** as part of learning **backend development**.  
It's a web-based **scholarship management system**.  

My goal is to just **practice backend and database** while creating a functional project.  
This helps me understand **how the frontend communicates with the backend**, and how data flows between a Backend and a Database.
